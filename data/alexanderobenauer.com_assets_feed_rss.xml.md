I have two things to share with you today:

First, we’re starting a publishing company.

Second, I wrote a book about computing, out soon.

Let’s start with the book:

I’ve had a bunch of versions of the same conversation with curious friends and
family over the years: folks are generally aware that computers “use binary”,
but want to understand how they build up from there to all the things we
recognize as modern computing today. This book answers that question.

Over ten chapters, it illustrates how we built each layer of computing out of
the one before, and the models of thinking that got us there. It’s a short,
technical book for curious, non-technical people.

It’s called _Bootstrapping Computing_, and I’d love for you to have a copy,
share one with your most curious friend, and enjoy these wonder machines before
us a little more with me. While it’s written for a non-technical audience, I’ve
greatly enjoyed how it has helped me solidify my thinking about the fundamentals
of computing; the ingredients for my everyday work.

Each book is archival quality and made by hand in Tennessee. The cover is a hard
case wrapped in smoke grey book cloth, and the 112 pages are printed in full
color using pigment-based ink on 80 lb warm white paper sewn with accented linen
thread.

It comes out at the end of March, and you can
[preorder now](https://buddybindery.com/products/bootstrapping-computing).

Now, [the publishing company](https://buddybindery.com) I am starting with
Sarah, my wife:

We care a great deal about books. But most of the books coming out today aren’t
that good — in content _and_ construction. Too many would be better as shorter
books, but include lots of filler. And too many are just poorly made, and don’t
stand the test of time.

Authors don’t have many great choices. Self-publishers are pushed to use
print-on-demand services, which have mixed quality. Or when working with a
publisher, authors have to give up lots of quality and control to fit that
publisher’s idea of a good book, and leave all of the most interesting decisions
about the construction of the book to what would be produced the cheapest.

We want to help build “the ninth path” for today’s authors and readers. Our
company is building all of its own books in-house. They are archival quality,
handmade using the best materials and methods. Folding, sewing, gluing, cutting,
casing-in, pressing — it’s all done by hand. If well-cared-for, these books will
last generations.

We’re starting by publishing some of our own works, and if things go well, we
will move into publishing books by other authors.

And honestly, I’m most excited to be working with Sarah again. We do some of our
best work together, and making books together has already been a dream come
true. We hope you’ll pick up a copy of our first book, and sign up to hear about
our new releases.

There’s nothing quite like a really nice, physical book that anchors your
personal library, the kind that you leave on your desk for days or weeks after
you’ve read it — having the words dutifully cared for and brought to you in a
beautiful, tactile physical construction — it’s one of my favorite things in the
world.

I’m looking forward to learning what it takes to make great books, and making
them for you.

part one is up now.

**[The Interfaces With Which We Think »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/think/)**

Here’s the introduction:

I’ve got two projects to share with you today:

First up is an essay about OLLOS, a personal computing environment that
organizes your things on the dimension of time, which I worked on and in from
2021 to 2023.

The essay includes a demo video, and covers everything from the project: how it
works & how I used it, design and concept iterations, future work for it and the
OS, and what I learned about personal interfaces.

Read on:
**[OLLOS: An itemized personal computing timeline »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/ollos/)**

Last year, I worked with independent research lab Ink & Switch on a new project
that explores how to reorganize personal computing away from the over-abstract
and rigid user environments of today.

Embark separates the data, functions, and interfaces users need, then lets users
recombine these pieces for their own needs and context.

In today’s lab note, we explore how the operating system of the future might
become more supportive of the unique needs and context of our lives:

While exploring an OS which is made up of all the items in your digital life,
it’s easy to wonder if things would become a mess rather quickly. In the latest
lab note, I explore ways in which an itemized OS might help us keep organized,
without the tedium.

A huge thanks to [Val Town](https://www.val.town) for sponsoring my work this
month, helping make my independent research possible.

I’ve been a big fan of what they’re building: you can create “vals” (little code
snippets, like Gists), run them, schedule them, call them via API, or even call
them from other vals. Everyone gets a namespace, and you can call other people’s
vals from your own, and publish yours to be called elsewhere too. There’s lots
more to it, which you can see in this
[demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/c075dc075909400a85591ac3f83d1ca5?t=265).

Watching how others interact with their computers has long been a fascination of
mine. There’s so much to glean from lots of little details as someone goes about
their life and life’s work on their personal computing devices.

One of the more shocking anecdotes from this fascination kicks off my latest lab

If you’re looking for something more to read this weekend, here’s some other
things I’ve published this year:

- [WonderOS](https://wonderos.org) is an ongoing research project exploring an
  itemized user environment.
- [Hello, Operator!](https://wonderos.org/hello/) is WonderOS’ guide to the
  itemized environment, an initial exercise exploring how computer literacy
  might be attained by society at large with systems of this type.

One part of the project that I’ve begun publishing, though it isn’t yet
complete, is the operator’s handbook for WonderOS. It is presented as the manual
that would come with the user’s first itemized personal computing device.

_Hello, Operator!_ is an exercise in exploring how computer literacy might be
attained by society at large with systems of this type, and how people might
learn to use the core primitives of itemized, malleable systems to evolve them
for their changing times and needs.

Thanks to WonderOS, and the other experiments it has produced, I’ve been living
inside itemized environments in more of my personal computing life lately, which
has produced delightfully odd and interesting insights that build on the
fundamental ideas proposed in my lab notes.

As I continue to tinker with these experiments, those insights will land back in
the lab notes; in fact, most of the latest ones feature new thinking that has
come out of WonderOS and the experiments it supports.

Earlier this year, we explored fluid workspaces — a way to navigate our OS of
the future with greater ease.

Today, we’re expanding on that concept with a new way to think about our digital
workspaces and how they might be reified within our itemized systems.

The latest iPhone’s new feature, Dynamic Island, follows a long line of ways OSs

the decades.

Once I started using my itemized OS, I quickly felt limited by some of the basic
concepts.

Today’s lab note explores one experiment to change that. A word of warning: it’s
somewhat complex to discuss, because it entails the consequences of two
alternate ideas for navigation in an OS of the future — so maybe grab your cup
of coffee first.

When designing my “OS of the future”, there are lots of interesting interface
ideas to consider. The most interesting ones are patterns that could be used
throughout the system with many different kinds of items.

Today’s lab note is about one of those patterns. It’s nothing groundbreaking,
but it starts to show some of the styles of thinking that an itemized OS could
allow for.

Lots of demos in this one! Read on:

As we’ve explored the idea of an itemized OS of the future, we’ve considered
something with immense flexibility; but how does the user make that flexibility
work well for them?

A series of demos, starting in the next lab note, will explore exactly this. But
first, today, I want to lay some groundwork:

[LN 029: Experimenting with the item as the core primitive »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/029/)

In the next few lab notes, I’ll share with you my project that I’m currently
working on (here’s a
[little preview](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer/status/1513195682965995527)),
and lots of demos that take this experiment — of the item as the core primitive
— as far as we can.

We’ve explored lots of possible features for the OS of the future. But how
should systems of the future reify their functionality? How should they make
their primitives available to users? Who has the ability to evolve these systems
long into the future?

This week’s lab note considers how flexible systems could work for users of all
levels of computer literacy:

In the [last few Lab Notes](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/), we
explored what the future of the OS might look like on an itemized internet. Now
let’s take that back to your own devices:

What if you could have your own, personal computing network? And what kinds of
devices could you add to it?

take these systems online? Could a user build an online store from the itemized
system? Or an appointment booking service?

Today, we continue to explore taking itemized systems online, but this time, in
modules with behavior:

over, even though the concepts are settled.

on where my core research work is headed this year.

Read it here:
[​2022: Expanding the exploration »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/2022/)

This is all in the article, but here are some highlights:

- Last year, I experimented with publishing all of my thoughts and work
  exploring the future of the operating system in 19 Lab Notes and a handful of
  other articles.
- In addition to writing and prototypes, I also published one experiment, an
  open source plugin for Obsidian that explores an implementation of some
  concepts found in my Lab Notes.
- I also worked on a handful of other small projects, most recently including
  [a habits app](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer/status/1468306363394801672)
  that I created for myself (I’ll publish some on this as soon as I can learn a
  bit more from using it).

And looking ahead:

- In 2022, my high aim is to meaningfully expand and deepen my current
  exploration of personal computing’s future.

Notifications stand to be one of the most important things in our personal
computing domain. But in today’s OSes, this sacred space fails to achieve that
ideal because it is home to others’ priorities over our own.

My next lab note on notifications in the OS of the future is live now.

The show I launched this fall, Songs I’m Made Of, is halfway through its first
season. We discuss songwriting and play some tunes with songwriters throughout
the world. The first six episodes are out now, and feature a wide range of
genres and inspirations.

As I begin developing the concepts I’ve laid out in my Lab Notes so far into an
environment anyone can use, some thinking needs to be ironed out around how the
system works internally.

That’s what we’re exploring in today’s lab note. It contains ideas that build on
top of the system’s itemized fundamentals.

Read it here:
[LN 018: Services, Actions, Automations, and Item Drives »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/018/)

Any of the prototypes you’ve seen within my Lab Notes so far are just that —
prototypes. But what I’m working on now is an app that you can run on your
existing computers and devices that serves as a personal computing environment
implementing these concepts, letting you use them with your own data and use
cases.

The biggest question I have at the moment is: how do we measure success? It’s an
experiment, but one without clear, objective outcomes. For example, if the goal
is increased productivity, the measurement might be clear. But if the goal is
expanded creativity, the measurement might be much less clear.

Last week I launched Songs I’m Made Of, the half-discussion, half-music show
that explores the craft, process, and inspirations of some incredible
songwriters that I had the pleasure of interviewing.

You can tune in now on Spotify. The first three episodes are up, and you can
expect new episodes every Friday this fall.

Before we get into the future of the OS, I have a new project to share with you.

Longtime subscribers already know of my fond love for music. In the last several
months, I’ve been working with songwriters from various genres to record a new
podcast.

The show blends discussion and music, as I sit down with songwriters to talk
about their work and their biggest inspirations. The songs we discuss play
within each episode.

The show is called Songs I’m Made Of, and it begins next Friday. To find out
more, or to sign up for updates, head the website:

There’s a lab note I’ve had in the works for some time now on web browsing in
the OS of the future. A concept I prototyped allowed users to browse the “static
web” without javascript (and some other things). If a user wanted to allow
javascript on a page or domain, they could enable the URL as an “app,” causing
the system to treat it as such, both in its behavior and how you might navigate
to it.

When using “the static web,” I’d land on news articles that didn’t jump around
as ads loaded; I could simply read the content. Cookie banners and other popups
stopped covering the things I was trying to read. And the few sites I wanted to
behave like apps within my system would be specifically identified.

It was transformative… _for today’s web._

Over time I’ve begun to wonder if the thinking is simply too short-sighted for
the project.

When you go back and read
[Bush’s As We May Think (1945)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/),
[Engelbart’s Augmenting Human Intellect (1962)](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138),
and similar visions of the past’s future, you’ll find plenty of things that we
often describe as “predicting the web,” and though true to an extent, those
articles illustrate so much more; some of the most compelling thinking —
illustrated more than a half-century ago — hasn’t yet materialized in widespread
technology.

The best analysis I’ve read on this came from Alan Kay, one of our industry’s
pioneers who has helped make computing what it is today (among other things, Kay
is also a professional jazz guitarist & composer).

In response to a question asked on Quora, “Should web browsers have stuck to
being document viewers?” Kay responded with a wonderful analysis on how we got
to where we are today, and the missed paths along the way. His answer begins
clearly, “Actually quite the opposite.”

Read it in full here:
[Kay’s answer on Quora »](https://www.quora.com/Should-web-browsers-have-stuck-to-being-document-viewers/answer/Alan-Kay-11)

What should the future of the web look like, how should it relate to the future
of the operating system, and how does today’s web map into that vision, if at
all?

When you read my [Lab Notes](#) on the future of the operating system, you can
start to see some clear hooks into these concepts for a compelling “web of the
future” that could begin to materialize some of yesterday’s unrealized visions.

This is all “food for thought,” as I want to spend some months exploring the
topic more deeply while continuing to prototype my operating system of the
future.

Two other notes:

If you’ve emailed me recently, I apologize for not responding yet! There’s been
an uptick in responses to my lab notes. Every time I get a thoughtful email, I’m
excited to dig in. I will read what you’ve sent me & continue the conversation

And one thing I’ve noticed with my work is that as a new project shifts from
being consumed mainly by hobbyists to professionals, engagement shifts from the

with this edition, I’ll experiment with sending these letters on weekdays.

You can see these concepts, designs, and prototypes in my lab notes so far:

[Read the Lab Notes »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/)

Why the operating system? Why personal computing?

Personal computing is one of the most important things humanity has ever built,
and it’s on every desktop and in every pocket. It’s surprisingly ubiquitous:
right around half the global population has a smartphone, which is a personal
computing device; people who don’t have electricity have smartphones, people who
don’t have homes have smartphones.

It’s the foundation on which we conduct much of our lives today: it’s where we
do much of our life’s work, it’s where we capture and develop our thinking, it’s
the medium through which we connect with our loved ones and peers, it’s often
where we learn new things, and it’s our connection to the internet and world at
large.

Personal computing, along with the operating systems that foster it, is one of
the most important things we’ve ever made, and it helps people in nearly every
cross-section of the global population.

How will pioneering and trustworthy personal computing be made available to the
world’s population in 50 years? In 100? What should it look like? Who should be
charged with directing its future, and how?

It’s up to us, as a collective industry, to make sure we build on the rich
legacy handed to us by continuing to build towards the future that the next
generations deserve from ours. For me, that means constructing the concepts for
personal computing’s next phase of life that continue to push it radically
forward, and ensure that it does not become an adversary to the people who use
it.

Last week, we explored some concepts around how your operating system can adapt
itself according to how all of your digital things relate to one another.

To explore this concept futher, I’ve built a plugin for the notes app Obsidian
that implements many of these ideas within a graph of notes.

I’ve published a video demoing it, along with an article and the plugin itself,
all in my next lab note.

In my lab notes so far, we’ve explored a handful of new and renewed concepts for
the operating system of the future. There are more to come, but today I want to
pause and consider the bigger picture, starting with some of those concepts
themselves:

What if you could transclude anything in your personal computing domain within
any other thing? [Demos of this](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/003/)
included dropping a podcast episode into the note you’re developing your
thoughts in, letting you pause and play the episode whenever you open the note
again.

What if you could develop your thinking or work in browsing paths that can
contain all the items you need, regardless of type or source? And what if you
could return to your recent paths anytime?
[Demos of this](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/004/) included moving
from your day’s task list into a project that required taking down notes and
tasks while researching a specific topic with assets in your path, and returning
to this path later to continue the work.

What if your system could identify associated items from past browsing paths
when you have items open?
[Demos of this](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/005/) included having
automatic recall of the email thread about a meeting from the meeting’s calendar
event notification?

And the list goes on: What if you could
[swap out](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/006/) the views used to render
specific items? These views might come from third-party developers, or what if
you could [create your own](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/009/) views
for items? What is the result of using
[references](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/012/) among your things that
form an [items graph](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/014/) of everything
in your personal computing domain?

All of these individual concepts contribute to an explorative operating system
of the future — or more specifically, to the user environment of one.

The demos you see in the above lab notes all work, and for the most part,
together. Building out the concepts helps me learn more about them, from both
implementation and use. But the next step is becoming more clear: letting others
use them too.

So here’s my plan: over the course of the next few months, I hope to share with
you this system I’ve developed. As a fullscreen app for your current machine, it
becomes an alternative user environment in which you’ll be able to explore these
concepts with your own work and data.

What concepts need more thinking? What gaps exist? Is this something that is
only incrementally better than today’s operating systems, or is the difference
more meaningful than that? How does it affect the ways we think or work? There
are lots of questions I hope to explore by sharing these first implementations.

In the meantime, I’ll keep the lab notes coming with more of the concepts I’m
exploring.

As always, I hope you’re well.

The deeper I get into [research](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/) on
the future of personal computing, the more convinced I become of the need for
art in society.

Great tech amplifies human capability.

But it amplifies everything — the good, and the bad. We’ve seen this play out
for years.

On the other hand, great art (such as music) causes us to introspect,
understand, and empathize. It’s biased towards amplifying the best of humanity.

One more contrast:

Software depreciates, art appreciates.

A book or a record, for example, appreciates with time; it becomes more
valuable, not less. It does not require constant maintenance and upkeep just to
keep it from dipping below some bar of quality. Once the book is printed, it
might exist for hundreds of years. Same with a movie: generations after yours
might enjoy it. But software? Code written today may be obselete in just a few
years, even with ongoing maintenance.

This isn’t to discredit software or building it — it’s what I do for a living!
Software allows us to do some wonderful things. But it’s important in my own
practice to understand the true impact of the things we build. These contrasts
beg for some questions that haven’t been asked nearly enough in building some of
the software used globally today.

Curious to hear your thoughts.

As a kid, I found two things that were pure magic to me: computers and music.

They held so much potential for expression and ideas, and so much potential for
making life great.

Music never disappoints.

But computers do.

Computers simultaneously mesmerize _and_ disappoint me. I think this is why
computer science is ultimately the field I went into. Lots of things fascinate
me, and lots of things disappoint me. But it’s computers that do both. They
harbor so much potential, yet so often they fulfill very little of it.

My work in software has always been borne out of this gap: How can software
improve people’s daily lives? What concepts might open up our thinking and
elevate what we’re capable of producing? Who should be in charge of the future
of personal computing, and how should they be charged with its direction?

**Keep reading in
[How I approach my core work](https://alexanderobenauer.com/work/), recently
updated with a few new sections.**

Today our thinking on user interfaces is severely constrained: “This text box is
_here_. I can only change what’s inside it.” In five years’ time, we should
think of changing any data _or_ view as “changing my stuff” — effectively the
same class of action; making your software reflect your thinking, just the way
you want. Today, we don’t feel like these are personal computers. “The text box
is _there_. That is up to someone else. They might change it in an update. That
isn’t up to me, the user.”

So often, we want to redo our office, remodel our kitchen, reconfigure our
workspace, or refurbish our RV. Our minds naturally consider how our
environments could be improved to better our experience and effectiveness within
them. Yet we don’t do this with our software — for the most part, we can’t. We
spend an enormous amount of our lives on our personal computing devices, and yet
today, we do not have the freedom to redesign, remix, remodel, or reconfigure
our digital workspaces.

All of us have vastly different kinds of work to do in our lives, yet we all
have the same workshop from which to do it all.

\]\]> <!\[CDATA\[Why is our thinking on computers so restrained?\]\]>
https://alexanderobenauer.com/weekly/20210626/
https://alexanderobenauer.com/weekly/20210626/ 2021-06-26T05:35:07.322Z

The computers we use are so capable, it’s almost hard to even fathom what we can
do with them.

We largely have not explored completely new models for computer thinking native
to the digital realm. We only use concepts native to the physical world,
simulated digitally.

Let’s start with one example of what we have today: files and folders.

My primary notes app is home to a large variety of things:

- Thinking (which I do by writing as I think)
- Writing (drafts of things I’m preparing to publish)
- Learning (notes on books I’m reading or topics I’m studying)

Plus a few other things.

I do each of these things among a few different sets of topics — music,
software, and so forth.

And each of these things I like to categorize as:

- Up Next (where I put all of the articles, podcasts, concepts, and so forth I
  stumble across and would like to dive into soon)
- Now (the things I’m working on at the moment)
- Past (essentially an archive of these things)

Any one note might be in three areas here: an idea might be in Thinking, Now,
and Software. Or a book I want to read next might be saved in Learning, Up Next,
and Music.

But my primary notes app follows the standard files-in-folders method of
organization, so I have to choose one hierarchical organization. Only one of
these methods of organizing my notes can be the first-order organization. If I
want to organize further, my second-order organization folders would need to be
replicated within each of the first-order folders. For example:

1. Thinking
   1. Up Next
   2. Now
   3. Past
2. Writing
   1. Up Next
   2. Now
   3. Past
3. Learning
   1. Up Next
   2. Now
   3. Past

This also means I always have to _think of_ my notes in this way; whenever I
want to dive in, I must think in this specific arrangement every time: Type
first, status second.

Sometimes I want to look at _all_ of my _books_: I’d like to see what I’m
reading now, what’s up next, and what I’ve read recently. Sometimes I want to
look at _everything_ that’s _up next_: books, podcast episodes, saved articles;
everything.

Sometimes I want to look at specifically what software books I have listed as up
next. Or I want to see all the books on music I’ve finished recently. Or just
the saved articles, on any topic, I’ve listed under up next. Or what thinking
I’m in the middle of fleshing out right now, in any topic. Then maybe I’d like
to focus in on one topic.

Each of these represents a different perspective into my things I have in
different situations. With a files-in-folders hierarchy, the experience is quite
frustrating, as I have to bend my use of the software to suit its model — which
is a model of the physical world, simulated digitally! There’s lots of clicking
and cobbling together a general idea of what I’d like to see at any moment.

The computer is capable of so much more. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be
able to see and interact with my things in ways that suit each of my uses
throughout a week.

Yet, in many apps, not even tags and labels solve this problem without constant
searching.

It might be difficult to fully consider the ways you would be able to reflect
your own true thinking or uses in a well-suited software concept because we are
so used to the metaphors our software has been based on for the last 50 years.
But I implore you to try! Consider what ways your uses or thought processes
could be more naturally reflected within your digital tools. (And if you want to
share your thinking, my inbox is always open!)

To sum up: Today, our computers still only augment our thinking by mirroring how
we operate things in the physical world. It affords us no new models of thinking
that we didn’t have before, just tweaked and scaled in different ways.

In the physical world, a file goes in a folder. If it has something to do with a
file that belongs in another folder, we just kind of need to remember that
association. This is how our digital tooling works too, even though digital
things have no constraint requiring such a compromise.

Over the years, we have introduced new models for thinking, but we largely have
not explored completely new models for computer thinking: ways of thinking about
things and organizing them native to the digital realm. We mostly use methods
native to the physical world, simulated digitally.

Why is this? Is it so hard to think about things beyond physical realms that our
brains can’t keep up? (I hope that’s not it.) Have we simply not stumbled into
the right ideas yet? Or are we iterating our way towards those concepts, just
slowly? Really, there’s no way to know looking ahead.

What kind of thinking is native to the digital realm? What hints do we have
today to show us the directions that ought to be explored further?

As always, thanks for coming along on this thought experiment. And if anything
stokes your own thinking on this, let me know!
