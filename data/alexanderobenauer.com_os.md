# The future of the operating system

What should the operating system of the future look like? Who should be in
charge of building it? How can personal computing push past its current
limitations? This research explores new and newly refined ideas for what the
operating system allows users to do. Reimagining the operating system — not
kernels and drivers, but the user environment — is my current research area, and
this work is in active development.

What does the operating system of the future look like? If you were to redesign
the OS from scratch, how would it work? What would it do for you?

If your initial answers are anything like mine, they are quite terrible: bad,
uninteresting, impossible, or myopic. But once you get the bad ideas out, you
make way for the good ideas.

Have you thought about this before? What would your ideal operating system look
like?

What would it look like first thing in the morning? Last thing in the evening?
Throughout the day?

What would it look like on a laptop? Or on a mobile phone? Or on a drafting
board-style computer like the Surface Studio?

What goals would it strive for? How would you design it to build the future of
personal computing closer to what you believe to be its best contribution to the
human race? How would you design it to get away from what you believe is wrong
about today’s operating systems and the companies that make them?

The questions are many but they all get down to one extremely interesting core:

To you, what is the joy of computing?

Right? That is what is at stake here. How does the current world support the joy
of computing for you? How does the current world detract from it? In an ideal
world, how do you envision the joy of computing reified? Can that ideal vision
exist in today’s world?

## The pioneers’ vision

_“The computer is a medium!”_ Alan Kay — one of the forefathers of personal
computing — wrote this about a realization he had in the late 1980s. _“I had
always thought of it as a tool, perhaps a vehicle — a much weaker conception.
What McLuhan was saying is that if the personal computer is a truly new medium
then the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire
civilization.”_

The titans who envisioned and birthed personal computing decades ago had a
vision for how it would contribute to humanity. It is most tangibly communicated
in Steve Jobs’ now famous metaphor:

> “I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is
> that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
> locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy
> to move a kilometer. And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing,
> about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the
> crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.
>
> “But then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
> efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And a man on a bicycle, a
> human on a bicycle blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.
>
> “And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
> most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of
> a bicycle for our minds.”

This vision of the personal computer as a companion for advancing human thought,
human capability; where does it stand? How have we done in the last 30 years?

In some regards, extraordinarily well.

In others, you could argue the potential is left mostly unfulfilled.

## Expanding human capacity

With software as the medium, we do a great deal of our thinking, creating, and
collaborating; we conduct our life’s work.

This entire medium — from the user environment of the operating system to the
various applications we use within it — is our digital companion in the best of
our efforts.

If this medium could be meaningfully improved, the potential impact would be
huge. It would mean being able to expand human capacity to think, create,
collaborate, and do — in all of humanity’s best endeavors.

It would mean installing a gearbox onto the bicycle for the mind, and being able
to kick into a higher gear.

This is the primary aim of my research into the future of personal computing.

Much of this research will revolve around new and renewed ideas for the user
environment of the operating system of the future. We will also explore how
software is built, the business of software development, and a few other related
topics.

Today’s operating systems do not support the best for the user; usability tends
to fall prey to other priorities. Your — supposedly personal — computer must be
constantly reconfigured to be supportive of your best work. Though often
unintentionally, most software we use today is actively detrimental to the
plight.

Doug Englebart was prophetic in his work, and knew what personal computers could
be capable of when he sought to
“[augment human intellect](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138).”
Many of his designs and inventions form the underpinnings of personal computing
as we know it today.

Yet much of what he envisioned for personal computing remains unfulfilled. He
feared as much in 1995 when he said of his team’s incredible visions for
personal computing that _“these architectures are too important to allow their
evolution to be dominated by simple, vendor-customer market forces.”_

Prophetic, too, was this fear — we have indeed seen this limitation on the full
potential of the ideas he and many of the early pioneers saw in personal
computing.

My work aims to realize many of these unfulfilled intentions for modern users.

Put very simply: We push much of our thinking out into our computers so that we
can think about more things.

Naturally, better systems used for this task present a wild opportunity; since
we fill our software with our own things, our own thinking, our own plans, and
so on, better software has the opportunity to transform and open up our thinking
on the stuff that matters most to each of us.

A series of thoughtful concepts can help open your mind to _your own thoughts_ —
when you’re developing them, reflecting on them, connecting them, or organizing
them. That is not a small thing: Better concepts can open your mind to your own
thinking.

The premise is simple:

If there is a better way our personal computers could work — a way that would
meaningfully expand the human capacity to think, create, collaborate, and do —
then discovering and building that better way would improve society
tremendously.

This is my current area of research. I do not purport to have all the answers,
but I am armed with questions, and a few promising approaches for answering
those questions.

## Introduction to the research

Envisioning the ideal operating system will not be done in a vacuum, requiring a
fictitious world to work well. In [my core work](/work), I find the deepest
insights come from working in both abstract and application. My prior
[work in email](/email) did not supplant “ideal email” into the world, but found
ways to build it within today’s protocols. Similarly, this research will involve
figuring out how to engineer, and potentially deliver, its best ideas.

In fact, beyond the ideas and designs, this work has already involved building a
number of prototypes on different software stacks.

It has also led to [Symphonies](https://symphonies.app), a testbed for some of
the ideas as they are developed.

The aim of this research is to discern a compelling vision for computing that
supports the improvement of the human condition; one that helps to further reify
the ‘bicycle for the mind’.

How can personal computing be so improved that we can fulfill its promise of
expanding human ability? This is ultimately the question I am exploring, in
search of which paths don’t have answers and need to be cut, and which paths
yield surprising results and need to be explored further.

Through the process, I will share an ongoing stream of thinking and creating:
the ideas, thoughts, designs, and research in process, along with the products
spun off of the core research.

We will dive into depths beyond the future of the operating system itself, but
also the future of email, of software development, and a myriad of other related
topics. We will explore ideas and designs for software that doesn’t yet exist
– but might. And we will experiment with many of these ideas as they find their
way into Symphonies.

What we find will be published for the public good. What we learn I will use in
the products I create. And the primary goal is clear: to help discover, discern,
and construct a meaningful, shared vision for the future of computing.

For many years, control over that vision has remained in the hands of a seldom,
resourced few. But what made computing great from the start, what made the World
Wide Web great from the start, and what has always made indie software great:
these were not directed by any single entity; these were ultimately constructed
by many, each with their own contributions, each with their own strong ideas.
What resulted in ‘personal computing’ as we know it is a beautiful
conglomeration of some of the best ideas put forward by the community at large.

This research aims to carry on that great tradition by contributing; as a part
of that community, contributing back into that community, for the sake of what
we believe about the role personal computing can have in our futures.

My work has always been made possible only by the community: from its roots
with crowdfunding on Kickstarter, sustained by community-aggregated news rather
than marketing, through today with community-supported products. This research
aims to be no different in that regard.

Join me in this thought experiment: Come along just to enjoy the ride, or even
to help unfold some of the clues along the way.

## Questions

The kinds of questions this research aims to address:

**How can the OS of the future expand human ability** to think, create,
collaborate, and do? How can the operating system be improved to bring an order
of magnitude or more of change to what they enable people to do?

**How can the OS of the future balance context and periphery with focus and
flow?** How can the OS of the future help us with deep work? How can the OS of
the future allow us to have what we want in our periphery to guide and motivate
our work (akin to a current book sitting on the desk)? And how can the OS of the
future balance these two?

**How can the OS of the future be more respectful of our humanity**, our time,
our desire to focus, our need to relax, or our openness to spontaneity? How can
it allow us to stay centered in the mornings and evenings?

**How can the OS of the future be more respectful of the intentions of its
users**, rather than those of its (or apps’) creators? Advertisements in push
notifications and prompts to upgrade to vendors’ services in primary OS menus
are both evidence of a more deeply rooted problem.

**How can the OS of the future help us become better people?** Better versions
of ourselves, whomever we strive to be? Better at what we do? And how can the OS
of the future work to avoid distracting us from that progress?

**Who should be building the OS of the future, and how should its business be
run?** There is lots to unpack here, and this will be one of the primary focuses
within this research.

**Are files and folders the best storage mechanism?** Likely not — but what is?
And if a user’s data is synchronized to servers they don’t own, how can privacy
be absolutely / technologically guaranteed?

**How can security be balanced with openness?** If I own a computer, I should be
able to install and run any software I own without anyone’s permission. Or as a
developer, I should be able to develop any non-malicious software I want for the
platform, I should be able to run it on my machine without anyone’s permission,
and I should be able to distribute it to users in a manner of my choosing:
independently through my own mechanism, or on a platform of someone else’s
creation. What security models could exist to safely enable this ownership?

**How can the OS of the future support a vibrant third-party developer
ecosystem** that works well for developers _and_ consumers? Who should be in
charge of how that ecosystem works?
