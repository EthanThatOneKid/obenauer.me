# The Inverted OS

This week we begin in earnest.

The first of my Lab Notes exploring new concepts for the future of the operating
system is live now.

Dive in: [LN 002: Universal data portability](/labnotes/002)

Exploring the future of the operating system is going to involve lots of looking
back at where we’ve been (but sometimes forgetten), looking around at what folks
are coming up with today, and looking ahead at what might be possible (if we
give ourselves the freedom to rethink everything).

Looking ahead, as we begin to do in today’s lab note, will involve exploring new
fundamentals and building up on top of the new foundation these form.

The fundamental we explore today “inverts” the operating system, in a sense,
when compared to present-day operating systems. And it’s one of the new ways in
which [Symphonies](https://symphonies.app) works, too.
