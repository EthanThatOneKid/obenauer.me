# The merit of ideas and ideation

There is a wildly uninformed saying, “ideas are worthless.” It’s usually used as
an abbreviated way to say “ideas are worthless _without execution_,” which is
simply untrue.

Ideas aren’t worthless. Ideas are magic.

As creators, ideas are our lifeblood. Exploring them, even without executing on
them, has great merit. Knowing how to come up with and develop ideas effectively
is a tremendous skill.

## Practicing scales

Recently, I saw this question on Twitter: “What is the equivalent of a musician
practicing scales for what you do?”

For me, it’s thinking and ideating. These are
[the activities of my core work](/work). I seek to understand problems better,
and develop my and others’ ideas further.

Saying “ideas don’t matter; only shipping products matter” to a product creator
is like telling a musician “practicing scales doesn’t matter; only singles on
the radio matter.”

I enjoy exercises of thinking and ideating in areas completely unrelated to my
core work often; it keeps me sharp, my processes clear, and my mind flexible.
And sometimes these unrelated ideations unexpectedly intersect with my core
work, advancing it in a surprising direction.

## Impossible ideas

Impossible ideas can lead to great, possible ideas. The
[Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere) is an example: It is
the concept of a hypothetical megastructure that could gather the energy needed
for interstellar travel. It involves surrounding a star with many nodes,
creating a net that could gather more energy than we can create on earth, and
directing it to wherever it is needed.

This concept is an impossible idea, but it has led to an entirely new way to
look for sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations: by watching stars
for a rhythmic “blinking” effect, which would imply that a sphere of many nodes
is passing around it. This very phenomenon has been witnessed a few times now,
and despite the low odds of these being Dyson spheres, organizations such as the
SETI Institute are following up on these interesting findings.

## The dots connect later

You have no idea where a sufficiently creative process of ideation will lead
you. [The dots connect later](/thinking/dots): You can’t connect the dots
looking forward, only looking back.

Great ideas can lead to other great ideas. They can inspire thought from new
perspectives, provoke the thinker to question something in a new way, or develop
some unexpectedly similar idea into new directions.

Even disconnected from any practical application, wild ideation has great merit:
Wild ideas can lead you to applicable ideas. Wild ideas can unexpectedly
intersect with current work. Techniques discovered while developing a wild idea
may be the perfect recipe needed in another body of work.

If we limit ourselves to only that which is immediately applicable — what will
immediately make us money, progress our current work, or is guaranteed to be
accepted — we will miss out on the best new paths that we can create for
ourselves and our work.

The most important advancements in my work have all come from ideas and ideation
on topics that had no clear application to my current work. Exploring
interesting ideas and engaging in regular ideation without regard for how
something interesting might apply to my current work has been the leading force
in my career.

## Ideating like a designer or a developer

By exploring ideas that I have no intention of executing on, I often lead myself
to even greater ideas which I very much do execute on. Sometimes it’s within
weeks, but sometimes it’s years later (and those are often the best ones).

It’s an instrumental part of the process; much like you’d find, more tangibly,
in graphic design or software development.

As a designer, you often explore design ideas you have just for fun. Maybe an
illustration becomes a shirt in your shop, or maybe it just sits on your
computer. You often try a couple of variations for your client: some
conservative, some daring. You know most of the variations won’t be used. But
you never delete the files.

In a month, a year, or a few years, as you’re working on something else, you
realize that an unused exploration, variation, scrap, or technique applies
perfectly. You adapt it to your new project, and everything clicks.

This happens in design work all the time, and though less visibly, it happens
just as often in thought work and other fields of exploration and creation.

The code that prints “Hello, World” on the screen is not terribly useful to
anyone but the developer, nor is it ever shipped, but it is tremendously helpful
in allowing the novice developer to begin laying the building blocks. More
advanced code never shipped can be tremendously helpful in allowing the advanced
developer to progress their own understanding of more complex software — much of
the code a developer writes is never a part of the final, shipped product.
Refactoring a few times to get to a better result sends lots of code to the bin,
never to be used — but that doesn’t mean it was useless; it was a part of the
process.

Just as the developer writes lots of code that never ships as a part of their
process, the ideator explores ideas never executed on as a part of their own
process.

## Brilliant teams

In the phenomenal book Creativity, Inc., Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull wrote, “If
you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a
mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and
come up with something better.” This quote can be misused to imply that the idea
does not matter; only the team matters.

But Ed says it very succinctly: with good ideas _as the goal_, a brilliant team
will get you there. If we can be brilliant at what we do, we can turn mediocre
ideas into great ideas. All it takes is a deeper understanding, and a willing
curiosity, followed eventually by a series of ideas burning to be experimented
with.

## A worthwhile endeavor

Ultimately, “ideas are worthless” is meant to say the same thing as “real
artists ship” — that nothing matters until you do something with an idea.
Whether or not that embedded message is true, the statement itself (probably
accidentally) devalues the merit of ideas and ideation.

Ideas and ideation, much like unshipped software, can be instrumental for the
ideator or creator to develop better and more interesting ideas. They are a key
part of the process to get at some of the best of what’s possible.

To say that ideas are worthless, or that ideation is worthless, is to be
completely blind to how the human mind works, to how innovation works, and to
how thinking works. It robs you of the opportunity to make profound, unexpected
discoveries. Ask any screenwriter if ideas are worthless, and they’ll likely
show you their journal full of scattered entries which have, quite often,
informed some of their best work.

This all means that finding, growing, and pursuing great ideas is a very
worthwhile endeavor. Trusting in the merit of ideas opens us up to the merit of
ideation and of improving our processes and effectiveness in ideation.

Exploring ideas wildly, knowing how to ideate effectively — these can lead to a
menagerie of novel insights that regularly infuse your work with something far
better than you’d otherwise expect. You open yourself up to surprising insights
and odd connections.

And when it does come time for execution: Great execution on great ideas is when
sparks turn to fire. I love it every time I see it happen.

Ideas aren’t meaningless. Ideas are a critical part of the process.
