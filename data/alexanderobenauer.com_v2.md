Interfaces we think with
------------------------

How might the interfaces we think with better serve people’s daily lives?

In my current work, I’m exploring new and renewed ideas for how personal computing can better serve people’s lives — expanding opportunity, agency, curiosity, and creativity.

### Lab Notes

Documenting as I explore the operating system of the future, I publish Lab Notes to “work with the lab door open,” inviting others’ thoughts along the way.

Experiments

![OLLOS logo](/assets/imgs/ollos.svg)

[OLLOS](/ollos/) explores interacting with items across the dimension of time.

Published in [lab notes](/ollos/) and [a member essay](https://members.alexanderobenauer.com/experimenting-with-spaced-review-in-ollos-65/).

[Tag Navigator](/labnotes/exp001/) explores views that organize items by their cross references.

Published in [lab notes](/labnotes/exp001/) and open sourced [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexobenauer/obsidian-tag-navigator).

![Little Lab logo](/assets/imgs/littleLab-LogoStacked.png)

I think of my practice as a “little lab” — an indie research lab-of-one.

My work is graciously made possible thanks to funding from the community. You can help by becoming a member of the Little Lab. Your membership helps me publish more lab notes, experiments, essays, and other work.

Plus, you’ll get access to members-only exclusives: early demos and experiments, member essays, and more.
