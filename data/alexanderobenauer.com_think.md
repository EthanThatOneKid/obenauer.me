The Interfaces With Which We Think

The concepts in modern operating systems — apps, windows, desktops,
notifications, and so on — have so permeated our understanding of personal
computing that it’s hard to imagine anything else, let alone believe there could
be anything better.

It’s easy to assume that this is, somehow, simply, _how computers work_.

But this can’t be further from the truth.

Consider our concepts of time: the day and year are based on the earth’s
rotation and orbit around the sun, yet the seven-day “week” and the twelve
months are constructs of human imagination, which hopefully serve us well.

Similarly, in computing, binary is how our chips process logic. But the apps,
windows, desktops, notifications, and such — these are all constructs of human
imagination. This is true of nearly all the systems, metaphors, and interface
patterns we’ve built on top of our binary-crunching chips.

Common as some of these concepts are, they are all manufactured attempts at
making personal computing easier for people to contribute to and use.

But today, our abstractions are holding us back.
