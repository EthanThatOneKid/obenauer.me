Making the OS of the future more helpful
========================================

While exploring an OS which is made up of all the items in your digital life, it’s easy to wonder if things would become a mess rather quickly. In the latest lab note, I explore ways in which an itemized OS might help us keep organized, without the tedium.

Read on:
[LN 036: Free and easy organizations and associations »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/036/)

This lab note is a “part 2” to the last one, so if you missed it, you can start here:
[LN 035: The Messy Desktop »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/035/)

Next up: I have some new experiments to share with you, and as always, more lab notes coming your way. Don’t touch that dial.



A huge thanks to [Val Town](https://www.val.town) for sponsoring my work this month, helping make my independent research possible.

I’ve been a big fan of what they’re building: you can create “vals” (little code snippets, like Gists), run them, schedule them, call them via API, or even call them from other vals. Everyone gets a namespace, and you can call other people’s vals from your own, and publish yours to be called elsewhere too. There’s lots more to it, which you can see in this [demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/c075dc075909400a85591ac3f83d1ca5).

_If you’d like to find out more about becoming a sponsor, [head to alexanderobenauer.com/sponsorship/](https://alexanderobenauer.com/sponsorship/). June and July are currently available._
