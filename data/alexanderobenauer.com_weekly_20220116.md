# Automation in the OS of the future

The way our itemized OS of the future is designed could very well open up the
potential for some of the most compelling automation available in personal
computing.

Read the lab note:
[LN 021: Automations »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/021/)

In a recently published (and well done) talk, Priscilla Chomba-Kinywa discusses
the needs and challenges of the billions who have no internet access, and what
can be done about it. These challenges became more clear than ever during the
pandemic, as people were no longer able to sell their goods to make a living,
and children could no longer access their schooling.
