# Gather a community

Gathering a community of my products’ users has brought a tremendous new
dimension to [my core work](/work) of researching and building software.

In the beginning, I initially envisioned having a Slack community with my core
customers to make conversations easier in support and when discussing feature
ideas.

But far more than that, it has been one of the biggest, if not the single
biggest, game changer:

**For rapid debugging** — before the community existed, if I couldn’t reproduce
an issue, I likely couldn’t fix it. With the community, I’ve been able to send
quick test builds in Slack to the user to isolate the issue with a quick back
and forth, eventually verifying a fix on their end. In most cases, this process
takes anywhere between two to five test builds to isolate the issue and test out
fixes. Many unique, unreproducable bugs have been ironed out this way — bugs
that previously would have gone unfixed.

**For my mental work health + motivation** — somewhat often, when I no longer
have the energy needed for development, I’ll see a Slack message come in
containing a mix of excitement for the product and a simple request. These often
provide me with the energy to keep building. Multiple times, I’ve shipped new
features from this midday boost provided unintentionally by someone’s post in
the Slack. Sometimes it’s from a new user, sometimes from a longtime user. But
very often, it is the energy within the Slack community that keeps me going, and
keeps pushing development forward, even when I would otherwise be at a loss for
the energy needed to keep building.

**For newfound personal and professional relationships** — some of the most
active users in the Slack community have become close friends over the years.
After meeting in the Slack, I have since started
[a podcast with Fabio Bracht](#),
[spoke to Gerald Aungst’s third- and forth-grade coding class](https://www.cheltenham.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=5784&ViewID=5C362021-826F-4E3A-9A89-942210D6BD20&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=9892&PageID=1),
and more informally grown longtime friendships with many other members. It is
truly a community: We’ve swapped takes during watch parties of industry events,
we’ve come together to support members’ major moments in life and work, and
we’ve helped each other solve problems. We have a channel just for those
learning to code (quite a few within the group) to get help from developers in
the community (also quite a few in the group). We have a channel for a remote
running club among Apple Watch wearers. And we have channels for all sorts of
other community topics.

**Ultimately, for the product** — we’ve dug into issues when feature requests
cut against the grain of the product ethos, discovered deeper truths, and built
better features that neither I nor the requester could have envisioned without
these chats. I create these products all day, and all of us in the community use
them every day, so improving the product (and improving that very process of
improving the product!) benefits all of us tremendously.

## Growing followers < Growing audience < Growing community

The unexpected benefits of gathering a community started before I had even
shipped the first product. I started the Slack a few weeks before the first beta
of Mail Pilot, just to get it ready. Immediately, people took to the Slack to
share their hopes and ideals for the new Mail Pilot, unencumbered by having seen
it yet. This is a tremendous source of input you _rarely_ ever get as a product
designer; seeing the product instantly influences people’s thoughts and
feedback. But hearing their thoughts before they know much of anything about
your product allows you to walk into the full gamut of thoughts uninfluenced by
your own, where the most interesting insights often lay. And better yet, they
were able to discuss these initial thoughts with one another, building on top of
each other.

Additionally, the existence of a customer community led me to discover
[pioneering users](/thinking/pioneeringusers), a kind of user that, when
supported the right way, can help propel a product forward. And within the
community, pioneering users can riff on each other’s ideas and remarks.
