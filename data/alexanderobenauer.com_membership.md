I think of my practice as a “little lab” — an indie research lab-of-one. I work on various experiments and projects exploring the interfaces with which we think, and publish lab notes, essays, experiments, and a newsletter, as well as members-only updates, experiments, field notes, and other work.

You can help fund this work by becoming a member of the Little Lab. It’s like an annual membership to your favorite museum: you support its core work, and as a member, you get special access to it.

Your support has a direct impact on how much of this work I get to do.



For the last several years, I've been exploring the operating system of the future. I believe personal computing harbors a lot of untapped potential. My experiments tinker with new and renewed concepts in search of that potential.

Progress is documented in [lab notes](/labnotes/000), [essays](/think), [demos](https://x.com/alexobenauer/status/1787898486471512188), and [experiments](/ollos) published for all.

New in 2024, members get access to the member portal, where they get updates on the work, in-progress experiments, the field notes, and more. Here are some screenshots of the portal:

New in 2025, members also get a discount on my book [Bootstrapping Computing](https://buddybindery.com/products/bootstrapping-computing).

With your support, more of this work becomes possible, as I can dedicate more time to independent research, writing, and collaborations. If this is something you want to see more of in the world, consider supporting my work with a membership. This is an experiment in community-funded research, something I’d love to see more of in the world as well.

Launching the membership program for its first year, this page used to say: “There’s more I can do with this research — exploring more questions, experimenting with more concepts, and publishing more writing and prototypes.” I’m proud to say that has since come to fruition. Thanks for helping make that possible.

If you have any questions, [get in touch](mailto:alexander@obenauer.com).
