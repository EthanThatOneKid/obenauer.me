# Actions in an itemized OS of the future

Let’s get back into exploring ideas for the future of the operating system.
We’ve explored the flexibility our personal computing environments gain with
items, and today we’re extending that flexibility with the actions you might
take on those items.

Read the lab note:
[LN 020: Item Actions »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/020/)

Last week, I sent along an overview of where this research has been so far, and
where it’s headed in the next year.

If you missed it, you can read it here:

To support this research, I launched a membership program. If you want to see
more work in this space happen in the world,
[consider joining](https://alexanderobenauer.com/membership/). You will be
directly supporting my research work, and in return, you’ll get access to a
members-only newsletter with more articles and works-in-progress, pre-release
and experimental software, and in some cases, discounts on things I sell. With
this support, I can spend more time on independent research, writing, and
collaborations.

A huge thank you to the members who have already joined — your support means the
world. Beyond the financial support, there is something compelling in knowing
that there is a formal charge from the community to do this work. I’m excited to
take this research to new places in 2022 with your help!
