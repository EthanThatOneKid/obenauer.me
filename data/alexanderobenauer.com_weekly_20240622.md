# Thinking about the interfaces with which we think

Today, I’ve got a new essay to share with you. It will land in a few parts, and
part one is up now.

Read on:
**[The Interfaces With Which We Think »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/think/)**

Here’s the introduction:

> The concepts in modern operating systems — apps, windows, desktops,
> notifications, and so on — have so permeated our understanding of personal
> computing that it’s hard to imagine anything else, let alone believe there
> could be anything better.
>
> It’s easy to assume that this is, somehow, simply, how computers work.
>
> But this can’t be further from the truth.

I hope all is well your way,

— Alex
