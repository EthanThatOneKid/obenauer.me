Notifications in the OS of the future
=====================================

Notifications stand to be one of the most important things in our personal computing domain. But in today’s OSes, this sacred space fails to achieve that ideal because it is home to others’ priorities over our own.

My next lab note on notifications in the OS of the future is live now.

The show I launched this fall, Songs I’m Made Of, is halfway through its first season. We discuss songwriting and play some tunes with songwriters throughout the world. The first six episodes are out now, and feature a wide range of genres and inspirations.

As always, I hope you’re well!
