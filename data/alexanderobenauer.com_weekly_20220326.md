What might the internet look like when we introduce items?
==========================================================

This week’s lab note begins a series of notes, all on the itemized internet.

What might the internet look like when we introduce items?

Read the lab note:
[LN 025: Publishing items »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/025/)



We’re now 25 lab notes (and one experiment) into these explorations. I last asked for some feedback at the fifth, so it’s a good time to do so again.

I’d love to hear from you: What do you want to see more of? What do you want to see less of? Any other thoughts or feedback?

You can simply [send along an email](mailto:alexander@obenauer.com?subject=Lab%20Notes%20feedback) with your responses!
