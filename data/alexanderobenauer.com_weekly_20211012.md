# Web browsing in the OS of the future

Before we get into the future of the OS, I have a new project to share with you.

Longtime subscribers already know of my fond love for music. In the last several
months, I’ve been working with songwriters from various genres to record a new
podcast.

The show blends discussion and music, as I sit down with songwriters to talk
about their work and their biggest inspirations. The songs we discuss play
within each episode.

The show is called Songs I’m Made Of, and it begins next Friday. To find out
more, or to sign up for updates, head the website:

There’s a lab note I’ve had in the works for some time now on web browsing in
the OS of the future. A concept I prototyped allowed users to browse the “static
web” without javascript (and some other things). If a user wanted to allow
javascript on a page or domain, they could enable the URL as an “app,” causing
the system to treat it as such, both in its behavior and how you might navigate
to it.

When using “the static web,” I’d land on news articles that didn’t jump around
as ads loaded; I could simply read the content. Cookie banners and other popups
stopped covering the things I was trying to read. And the few sites I wanted to
behave like apps within my system would be specifically identified.

It was transformative… _for today’s web._

Over time I’ve begun to wonder if the thinking is simply too short-sighted for
the project.

When you go back and read
[Bush’s As We May Think (1945)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/),
[Engelbart’s Augmenting Human Intellect (1962)](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138),
and similar visions of the past’s future, you’ll find plenty of things that we
often describe as “predicting the web,” and though true to an extent, those
articles illustrate so much more; some of the most compelling thinking —
illustrated more than a half-century ago — hasn’t yet materialized in widespread
technology.

The best analysis I’ve read on this came from Alan Kay, one of our industry’s
pioneers who has helped make computing what it is today (among other things, Kay
is also a professional jazz guitarist & composer).

In response to a question asked on Quora, “Should web browsers have stuck to
being document viewers?” Kay responded with a wonderful analysis on how we got
to where we are today, and the missed paths along the way. His answer begins
clearly, “Actually quite the opposite.”

What should the future of the web look like, how should it relate to the future
of the operating system, and how does today’s web map into that vision, if at
all?

When you read my [Lab Notes](#) on the future of the operating system, you can
start to see some clear hooks into these concepts for a compelling “web of the
future” that could begin to materialize some of yesterday’s unrealized visions.

This is all “food for thought,” as I want to spend some months exploring the
topic more deeply while continuing to prototype my operating system of the
future.

Two other notes:

If you’ve emailed me recently, I apologize for not responding yet! There’s been
an uptick in responses to my lab notes. Every time I get a thoughtful email, I’m
excited to dig in. I will read what you’ve sent me & continue the conversation
shortly!

And one thing I’ve noticed with my work is that as a new project shifts from
being consumed mainly by hobbyists to professionals, engagement shifts from the
weekend to the workweek. This work seems to be making that shift, so starting
with this edition, I’ll experiment with sending these letters on weekdays.

As always, I hope you’re well.
