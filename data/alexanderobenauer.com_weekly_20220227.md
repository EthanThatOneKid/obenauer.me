I’ve also published the first Member Magazine. It has a series of essays that explore the background thinking behind the more public work that I do. In this first issue, I explore the foundations of the research I’m doing now: why it matters, and what’s at the very core of it.

Members can [check out the first Member Mag here](https://alexanderobenauer.com/membership/portal/).

I’m immensely grateful — this experiment has already allowed me to dedicate more time to this work, and it shows how the community helps make this kind of independent research possible in the long run.



In our next few lab notes, we will continue to explore some of the larger ideas from today’s.
