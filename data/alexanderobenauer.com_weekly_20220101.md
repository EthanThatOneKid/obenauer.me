Expanding the exploration
=========================

2022 is officially here, and there’s lots to explore. I’ve published an article on where my core research work is headed this year.

Read it here:
[​2022: Expanding the exploration »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/2022/)



This is all in the article, but here are some highlights:

*   Last year, I experimented with publishing all of my thoughts and work exploring the future of the operating system in 19 Lab Notes and a handful of other articles.
*   In addition to writing and prototypes, I also published one experiment, an open source plugin for Obsidian that explores an implementation of some concepts found in my Lab Notes.
*   I also worked on a handful of other small projects, most recently including [a habits app](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer/status/1468306363394801672) that I created for myself (I’ll publish some on this as soon as I can learn a bit more from using it).

And looking ahead:

*   In 2022, my high aim is to meaningfully expand and deepen my current exploration of personal computing’s future.
*   I’m starting a membership program to support this work. If you want to see more work in this space happen in the world, [consider joining](https://alexanderobenauer.com/membership/). You will be directly supporting my research work, and in return, you’ll get access to a members-only newsletter with more articles and works-in-progress, pre-release and experimental software, and in some cases, discounts on things I sell. With this support, I can spend more time on independent research, writing, and collaborations.
*   In addition to exploring more questions and experimenting with more concepts, my longer-term goal for this work is to construct an experimental new environment and platform for personal computing.

As always, I hope you’re well, and… Happy New Year!
