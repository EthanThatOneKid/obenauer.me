A new experiment, and an Ink & Switch collab
============================================

I’ve got two projects to share with you today:

First up is an essay about OLLOS, a personal computing environment that organizes your things on the dimension of time, which I worked on and in from 2021 to 2023.

The essay includes a demo video, and covers everything from the project: how it works & how I used it, design and concept iterations, future work for it and the OS, and what I learned about personal interfaces.

Read on:

Last year, I worked with independent research lab Ink & Switch on a new project that explores how to reorganize personal computing away from the over-abstract and rigid user environments of today.

Embark separates the data, functions, and interfaces users need, then lets users recombine these pieces for their own needs and context.

I hope your new year is off to a good start, and I look forward to exploring wild ideas with you all this year.
