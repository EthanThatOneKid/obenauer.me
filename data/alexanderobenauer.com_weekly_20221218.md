If you’re new to these lab notes, it might be helpful to start [at the beginning](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/) first, or get a summary in [LN 014: The Graph OS](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/014/).

Finally, since I’ve last sent this newsletter, I’ve published a few things for members: A member update and demo of a new experiment I’ve been working on, as well as the second Member Magazine. Both are available [in the member portal](https://alexanderobenauer.com/membership/portal/). A huge thank you to all members for helping me make this unfettered research possible!
