# What are the fundamentals with which personal computing is done?

As we’ve explored the idea of an itemized OS of the future, we’ve considered
something with immense flexibility; but how does the user make that flexibility
work well for them?

A series of demos, starting in the next lab note, will explore exactly this. But
first, today, I want to lay some groundwork:

[LN 029: Experimenting with the item as the core primitive »](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/029/)

In the next few lab notes, I’ll share with you my project that I’m currently
working on (here’s a
[little preview](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer/status/1513195682965995527)),
and lots of demos that take this experiment — of the item as the core primitive
— as far as we can.
