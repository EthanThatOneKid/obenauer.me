No more compromises
===================

As users, we make so many compromises with our software today, but I don’t think we have to.

My lab note today touches on a big way in which the OS of the future might mean far fewer compromises, for both users and developers.

The lab note is live now:
[LN 006: Swappable views »](/labnotes/006)



This lab note is late because of a few developments that stole my focus last week — besides a rather large Mail Pilot update, I also began working to find someone to help with development.

I’m looking for a developer to contract some hours with each week on Mail Pilot. The work is in Swift, Svelte, and SQLite.

If you’re interested, fill out this [application](https://forms.gle/Gbm7f8tm6LRHR8QM6), or reach out [by email](mailto:alexander@obenauer.com). And if you know someone who would be a good fit, please send this their way!
