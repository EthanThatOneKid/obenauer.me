# How the OS of the future might really help us out

You get an email. It contains an event invite for a meeting. It’s also got a
meeting agenda PDF.

Your operating system today completely ignores the fact that these things are
all related. But what if it didn’t? That’s what this week’s lab note is all
about.

Alongside our fifth lab note, I’d like to get a little feedback.

Would you mind taking this survey? It’ll help inform my next few Lab Notes:

In my time after graduating from college, I still lived and worked near the
university campus, and regularly engaged with students after guest lecturing in
classes or speaking at events. Whenever I spoke on campus, I’d hear from a small
handful of potentially-entrepreneurial students who wanted to chat one-on-one.
Far and away, there was a most common question they’d ask in this setting.

They did not see a path forward for their work. It was about balancing income
and purpose. As they saw it, they had these options:

1. Go work for a large company, make a great salary, but do work which
   contributes little to humanity; work which contributes mostly to
   shareholder’s returns.
2. Go work for a nonprofit, make far less, but for the most part do work which
   contributes meaningfully to humanity — though likely not the most creative
   and technically challenging work.
3. Start their own company, likely make even less for at least a while, but be
   able to self-direct. The main question left here was, “how do I start a
   company that makes money and simultaneously contributes meaningfully to
   humanity?”

Of these three options, none of my mentees felt there was a solid path that made
sense. Some did the first, contending that they could make lots of money doing
less meaningful work at one of the big tech companies, and they could use that
money to strike it out on their own after two years. (None of these students
have since done the striking-it-out part in the nine years I’ve been following
along.)

Some did versions of the second, but have mostly floated around from nonprofit
to nonprofit, not yet having found a solid home for their work, ambitions, and
purpose.

A few have ventured into the third, where the remaining question continues to
plague the work: how do I make something that both makes money, and purposefully
contributes to humanity?

Finally, some have found new paths entirely. One finance student who was being
pushed to join one of the big three accounting firms discovered impact
investing, and joined a firm that directs its investments and mentorship into
teams which are doing great things for humanity. (Last I heard, she was quite
happy.)

In a letter advising his friend on how to navigate some life decisions, Hunter
S. Thompson once wrote:

I’ve discovered in recent years that, in my own life and work, independent
research is _my_ “ninth path.”

Today, it is increasingly simple (not easy, but simple) for an independent
researcher to fund their work. And by conducting and contributing research in
and to the public interest, it is both a way to make a meaningful living and
contribute to humanity.

For any creative or technical researcher, this path may very well bring together
purpose, profit, and the pursuit of one’s own specific interests.

It’s a path I’ve only just begun to [explore](/work/) in recent years, and hope
to understand more about this year.
