Hey there, I’m Alexander.

I’m interested in how software can better serve people’s daily lives.

My experiments often involve designing and developing many ideas — some of which
I build into publicly available products, which further informs my research.
Below is a compendium of my research areas, projects, and products.

My work is graciously supported by the community — if you want to join us, see
[memberships](/membership).

## The future of the operating system

In my current work, I am exploring new and renewed ideas for how personal
computing can better support people’s lives, expanding opportunity, agency,
curiosity, and creativity.

This work is primarily shaped by exploring the “operating system of the future,”
and creating an experimental new environment for personal computing.

### Lab Notes

While exploring the OS of the future, I publish Lab Notes that document my
progress, experiments, and concepts to intentionally “work with the lab door
open,” inviting others’ thoughts along the way.

## Reimagining email

My career began with reimagining email and finding ways to build that vision on
top of the existing email protocols.

Mail Pilot is an email client that introduced new perspectives and useful
features to email in 2012, including reminders (later adopted by other apps as
“snooze”). After a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign, it went on to become
the #1 paid app in the Mac App Store at launch. It is available today as a
native app for macOS and iOS.

Throttle is a service that introduced sender-specific addresses in 2015 to give
email receivers fine-grained oversight and control over the transactional and
bulk email headed their way, and is often turned to as a home away from the
inbox for less urgent email.

### Products

These products have come from of my research and experimentation in email.
