As always, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this week’s topic. You can reach me by [email](mailto:alexander@obenauer.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer).

And I greatly appreciate whenever this research is shared with others on Twitter or elsewhere. Increasing the surface area of these Lab Notes causes them to bump into more and more insights and support from others. If you have some time today, would you share it out? I’d be grateful!

I made a [table of contents](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/) for use when sharing these Lab Notes that guides new readers into the ideas. Feel free to use that link when sharing, or when catching up yourself. You can also simply use my homepage at [alexanderobenauer.com](https://alexanderobenauer.com).



Stay tuned: we have lots of interesting ground to cover in answering today’s question, which will span many Lab Notes. Back next week with #10.
