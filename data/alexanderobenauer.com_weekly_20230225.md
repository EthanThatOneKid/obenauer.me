If you’re looking for something more to read this weekend, here’s some other things I’ve published this year:

*   [WonderOS](https://wonderos.org) is an ongoing research project exploring an itemized user environment.

*   [2023](https://alexanderobenauer.com/2023/), an annual recap and update on my independent research and membership program.
