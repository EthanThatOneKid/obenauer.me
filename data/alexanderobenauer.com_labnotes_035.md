# The Messy Desktop

When I got to college, I learned a lot about computing fairly quickly, before I
even stepped into my first computer science course.

During my first year, a friend-of-a-friend needed help recovering a lost file.
At their dorm, I stood behind them as they opened their MacBook.

“Where was the file before it was missing?” I asked.

“Usually I just see it here…” they gestured to some windows in Pages. The
urgency of the situation became more clear: they’re working on a paper that’s
due soon.

“Alright, open Finder.”

_Silence…_ then, “What?”

“Open Finder…”

“What’s that?”

“Where all your files are?”

“Oh, I didn’t know that’s what that was called.” They closed all their open
windows, revealing a desktop that must have had hundreds of files, all
overlapping, all over the place. It was like an episode of Hoarders, but the
digital equivalent. No less frightening. We just opened the front door, and got
our first glimpse at what’s inside.

“Whoa. What’s going on here?” Shocked by what I was looking at, I was curious to
understand.

“This is how I get to my files?”

“You just keep them _all_ on your desktop? How do you ever find anything?”

“Yeah that can be annoying sometimes…” they said, in a sort of assumed, shared
complaint — “computers, eh?” kind of way.

“Click the blue smiley icon at the bottom of your screen.” Finder opens.

“What’s this?”

We found their file by opening the desktop folder in Finder and sorting by
recently updated. Stoked by this “new” feature on their computer? Not so much.
“That’s complicated?” they said of the Finder window, and sure enough, when I
checked in some months later, they were still at it with the piles on the
desktop, dragging files off of others to find one that’s currently needed, and
keeping the most important ones in little holes where fewer files piled up.

Delighted as we may be with our graphs of items, our backlinks and
transclusions, and any other means of organizing our things or calling them up
in different views for different purposes, if we’re looking at all of personal
computing, we cannot ignore what many would do when they just want to be done
with what they’re working on. And if we’re being honest, we have to admit: we do
it too.

When we’re in a rush, don’t want to be working on our present task,
overburdened, or multitasking — basically, when we’re experiencing much of human
life — we take the path of least resistance, even if it looks to others like a
far less efficient path. Sometimes, it’s the path that requires you to learn
nothing new; the most familiar. Sometimes, it’s the one that requires the
absolute fewest clicks, even if it means saving a file in an obscure place.
Sometimes, it’s propping up an earlier path of least resistance, going to
greater effort in order to co-locate misplaced items together.

It isn’t good enough for our systems to be _capable_ of beautifully perfect
organizations; we will find their messiest allowable state at some point. We
will be in a rush, we will click the easiest button, we will fall to the
system’s defaults some percentage of the time — whatever they may be.

How might our system’s defaults keep us organized? How can we get as many of the
helpful organizations available in an itemized, graph-based OS for free? How can
we put the most effective ways of using such a system on the paths of least
resistance?

An itemized system intentionally breaks down the boundaries of today’s apps and
their data siloes. With _all_ of your items in one system, and all capable of
being referenced from any and many other items, the messy desktop could get a
lot worse.

In the next lab note, I’ll cover some ways that I’ve tinkered with how an
itemized OS could help. But until then, I’m curious to know: have you seen any
promising directions?

## Notes

\[1\] Part of this story I left out: When I said to open Finder, they actually
opened Spotlight first, guessing that might be what I was referring to as
"Finder" — that was interesting!
