Bootstrapping Computing

How the layers of computing are built, from binary up to the web, and the models of thinking that got us there; a short, technical book for curious, non-technical people.

Currently available in a handmade archival quality clothbound hardcover and a full-color paperback.

The Interfaces With Which We Think

Updated! An introduction to my research — why it is what it is, why it matters, and what it’ll take to get right. Presented in multiple parts, discussing today’s mainstream interfaces, malleable software, and more.





](/think/)[

Jasper

A recreation of the user environment found on 1987’s Canon Cat, with an essay exploring the emergence of user conventions in a minimal system, and the merits of a document user environment.

OLLOS

An itemized personal computing environment that uses time as its organizing principle — organizing all your things in one unified timeline. Demo video with an essay on insights from living in this environment for several years.

![Itemized personal computing timeline](/assets/imgs/ollos-thumb-1.png)

Itemized personal computing timeline

![OLLOS](/assets/imgs/ollos.svg)

From 2021 to 2023, I worked on and in an experimental personal computing environment that was organized into one interface construct: the timeline.









](/ollos/)[

Embark

Dynamic documents for making plans; a reaction to the rigid interfaces and data silos in today’s modern app landscape.

With industrial research lab Ink & Switch.





](https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/)[

Breadboard

A small demo — of widgets which can donate data to the overall environment, and react to others’ donations — made in pursuit of the project that eventually became Embark, above.

With industrial research lab Ink & Switch.





](https://lab.alexanderobenauer.com/experiments/breadboard)[

WonderOS

An itemized user environment for personal computing with the Item Store for persistent storage, the Wonderful programming language for creating interfaces and programs, and an itemized user interface.





](https://wonderos.org)[

Item Store

The data model and persistent storage layer for the WonderOS user environment (above); a graph of items stored in a database of chronological fact tuples.

Lab notes

[

Gestural view construction

What if interfaces were as easy to construct as queries, letting you spin up views “from scratch” as needed? Demo of such an environment for extemporaneous interfaces.

](/labnotes/037/)[

The Graph OS

What if the entire operating system were to work like a notes graph? What if every individual digital thing could be linked or backlinked in your overall digital graph?





](/labnotes/014/)[

Tag Navigator

A demonstration of cross-reference navigation, an idea for the automated organization of items based on user references or tags. Implemented as a plugin for Obsidian.

How I approach my core work

My core work is independent research in computing, here’s the how and why.

About

I run [Buddy Bindery & Press](https://buddybindery.com) together with Sarah, my wife. We publish, and make by hand, archival-quality books. Our first few titles are our own works as we get familiar with the whole process.

We live on a ten acre homestead in New Hampshire. Before that, we’ve lived on the road for several years in a 2016 Fleetwood Bounder while traveling around America, and for several other years in Tennessee, after graduating from our alma mater, Virginia Tech.

My work focuses on the future of personal computing. Some is done independently, and some in collaboration with others (e.g. [Animist OS](https://animist-os.org), [Embark](https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/)). I publish essays and experiments, some publicly, and some just for [members](https://alexanderobenauer.com/membership/), whose support makes my work possible.

You can get in touch [by email](mailto:alexander@obenauer.com?subject=Hey%20there!&body=Alex%2C%0A%0AI%20was%20just%20on%20your%20website%2C%20and...%20%0A%0A), or come chat on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/alexanderobenauer.com), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@alexobenauer), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer).

Past

[Songs I’m Made Of](https://songsimmadeof.com) was a radio-style show with songwriters, where we discuss and play their songs and the ones that inspired them.

[1997.chat](https://web.archive.org/web/20200625021002/https://www.1997.chat/) was a faithful remake of AOL Instant Messenger — the sounds, away messages, animated buddy icons, et al. — made available during 2020’s early lockdowns to connect the world’s socially isolated with one other, and a little nostalgia. You can read [my article](https://alexobenauer.medium.com/introducing-1997-chat-instant-messaging-the-way-it-used-to-be-52e371bc7bf3) or [the Nylon article](https://www.nylon.com/1997-chat-aim-instant-messenger) for more context.

Acquired by a new owner in 2021.

[Simple Habits](https://simplehabits.xyz) is a simple habit tracker with widgets for iPhone. You can read [my Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/alexobenauer/status/1468306363394801672) for more context.

Products from earlier phases of my career:

[Mail Pilot](https://web.archive.org/web/20201204040931/https://www.mailpilot.app/) was an email client that introduced new ideas to email which have since become common in most email apps. It reached the #1 top paid app spot in the Mac App Store, and was featured in The New York Times (David Pogue: “an ingenious new email service”), TWiT (Leo Laporte: “a good app, and well worth it.”), and numerous Macworld reviews over the years (Nathan Alderman: “a clean, impressive, often beautiful way to manage unruly email”).

[Throttle](https://throttlehq.com) is a service that is the home for emails which shouldn’t be in your inbox, using unique email addresses per sender.
