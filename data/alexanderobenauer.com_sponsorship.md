Sponsor the Little Lab’s work.
==============================

During the month(s) you sponsor, a message thanking your support will be included in the footer across this website, in the newsletter, and in social posts.

Your sponsorship helps make independent research in personal computing possible. I work on various experiments and projects exploring the interfaces we think with, and publish lab notes, essays, experiments, a newsletter, and member letters.

Reach an audience of engaged, curious individuals thinking about the future of computing: When you sponsor my work, a message will be included on my website, in my newsletter, and in social posts throughout the month, thanking your sponsorship for helping make my work possible, along with your link, text, logo, and / or other image.
